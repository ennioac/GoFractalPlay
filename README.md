**GoFractalPlay**


Using my joy in Fractals as a way to practice Go programming.  Note that some parts of the code were generated using Duck.Ai,  all code was used as boiler plate and updated accordingly;  references to specific helpful articles are documented within code.

Future versions should include nicer graphics output.

Note that go.sum is included in source to aid in reproducibility.
